# Introduction
Welcome to the `gammaspotter-gui` documentation. This guide will walk you through each tab and feature, helping you to import, calibrate, and analyze your data.

## [Calibration Tab](calibrate.md)
Upon launching the GUI, the Calibrate tab is your starting point for setting up and fine-tuning your data. The key function of this tab is importing your first set of data and making a calibration, so this calibration can be applied to other datasets.

## [Analysis Tab](analyze.md)
Once your data is calibrated, the analyze tab can be used . Here, you can let the program do all the work for you. Just by pushing a button it will find the right isotopes with the right peaks you found in your data.
