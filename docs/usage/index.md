# Introduction
Welcome to the `gammaspotter` documentation. This guide will walk you through each tab and feature, helping you to import, [calibrate](calibrate.md), and [analyze](analyze.md) your data.

## [Calibration Tab](calibrate.md)
Upon launching the GUI, the Calibrate tab is your starting point for setting up and fine-tuning your data. The key function of this tab is importing your first set of data and performing a calibration, so this calibration can be applied to other datasets.

## [Analysis Tab](analyze.md)
Once your data is calibrated, the analyze tab can be used to perform various analysis tasks. This tab provides a range of tools and functionalities to explore and interpret your calibrated data.
